Notion‑Lite — Static demo
========================

What this is
------------
A tiny Notion-like static front end (HTML/CSS/JS). It's a simple demo meant to be deployed to GitHub Pages.
It stores demo notes and projects in your browser localStorage.

Files
-----
- index.html — main page (drop into repo root)
- styles.css — styles
- script.js — small interaction
- README.md — this file

How to deploy to GitHub Pages
----------------------------
1. Create a new GitHub repo.
2. Upload the files from this ZIP into the repository root (or push them).
3. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages and choose the branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and folder `/ (root)`.
4. Wait a moment. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

That's it. Enjoy your tiny workspace.
